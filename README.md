Note 
{Solution}: 
1. The code present in the repository will work on **ubuntu/linux** machines only and not on **windows** systems. Necessary changes needs to be done as the same library/functions works a bit different in both distributions. I will update the windows version also soon on my github account. <br />
  { <br />
  If you have windows system, you can use **OracleVM** and install ubuntu distribution on it. Learn about operating linux systems and get comfortable with it, then you are good to go. <br />
  }

2. Some features of dashboard might not work of chrome browser(mobile) <br />
   {  <br />
   Other browser like Microsoft Edge, brave-browser, Mozilla firefox supports all features <br />
   }
