Data set is taken from kaggle website available at this

Dashboard link : https://olympicdataanalysis.azurewebsites.net/

 
Note 
{Solution}: 
1. The code present in the repository will work on **ubuntu/linux** machines only and not on **windows** systems. Necessary changes needs to be done as the same library/functions works a bit different in both distributions. <br /> I will update the windows version also soon on my github account. <br />
  { If you have windows system, you can use **OracleVM** and install ubuntu distribution on it. Learn about operating linux systems and get comfortable with it, then you are good to go.  }

2. Some features of dashboard might not work of chrome browser(mobile) <br />
   {  Other browser like Microsoft Edge, brave-browser, Mozilla firefox supports all features 
   }
